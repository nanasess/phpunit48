**PHPUnit48** is a variant of [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/).  The purpose of this project is to make PHPUnit 4.8 compatible with the new PHP and to make it compatible with PHPUnit 6.

PHPUnit is an advanced product, but it is out of old PHP versions.  But unit testing is an important technique for migrating old projects to new versions.  This project bridges PHP 5.x to **PHP 7 and PHPUnit 6**.

> PHPUnit is a programmer-oriented testing framework for PHP. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.
